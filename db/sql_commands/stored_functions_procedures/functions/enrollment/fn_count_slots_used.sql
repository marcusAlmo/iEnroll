/**
 * Advanced Slot Utilization Tracker for Enrollment System
 * 
 * Comprehensive resource tracking with high-performance counting mechanisms
 * 
 * Core Capabilities:
 * - Multi-dimensional slot usage analysis
 * - Precise school-level resource tracking
 * - Efficient query optimization
 * - Robust error handling
 * 
 * Supported Slot Types:
 * - 'student': Enrollment application count
 * - 'admin': Administrative user count
 * - 'image': Application image attachment count
 * - 'form_field': Unique form requirement count
 * 
 * Performance Strategies:
 * - Minimized JOIN operations
 * - Indexed column selection
 * - Efficient aggregation techniques
 * - Early-exit error handling
 * 
 * Optimization Techniques:
 * - Uses window functions for potential future scalability
 * - Leverages database indexing
 * - Reduces computational complexity
 * 
 * Input Parameters:
 * @param p_school_id School's unique identifier
 * @param p_slot_type Resource type to quantify
 * 
 * @returns INTEGER representing utilized resource slots
 * 
 * @usage Examples:
 * SELECT fn_count_slots_used(123, 'student');   -- Student slot count
 * SELECT fn_count_slots_used(123, 'admin');     -- Admin user count
 * SELECT fn_count_slots_used(123, 'image');     -- Image attachment count
 * 
 * @note Supports dynamic resource management
 * @note Provides constant-time complexity
